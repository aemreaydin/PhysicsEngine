Physics 2 Project 2


The scene file is in the assets folder.
Move between the balls with TAB.
SPACE changes between Bullet and BadPhysicsEngines.
The force is constant but changing the ball removes the force.
The project is x64/Debug.

I added SetPosition, GetVelocity, SetVelocity functions to iRigidbody, cRigidBody and cBulletRigidBody to do the bonus part of changing between BulletPhysics and SuperBadPhysics.
